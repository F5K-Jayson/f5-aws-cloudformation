# Deploying the BIG-IP in AWS - 1 NIC

[![Doc Status](http://readthedocs.org/projects/f5-sdk/badge/?version=latest)](https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/bigip-ve-setup-msft-azure-12-1-0.html)

## Introduction

This solution implements an CloudFormation Template to deploy a base example of F5 in a cloud-focused single NIC deployment.  This is the standard Cloud design where the compute instance of
F5 is running with a single interface, where both management and data plane traffic is processed.  This is a traditional model in the cloud where the deployment is considered one-armed.

This solution provides two different template options:
  - **BYOL**<br>
  The BYOL (bring your own license) template allows you to input an existing BIG-IP license.
  - **Hourly**<br>
  The Hourly template which uses pay-as-you-go hourly billing
  
  The **existing stack** CloudFormation template incorporates an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). If you would like to run a *full stack* which creates and configures the BIG-IP, the AWS infrastructure, as well as a backend webserver, see the templates located in the **learning-stacks** folder.
  
## Documentation

Please see the project documentation - This is still being created

## Installation

You have two options for deploying this template: 
  - Using the AWS deploy buttons 
  - Using [CLI Tools](#cli)

### Using the AWS deploy buttons
The easiest way to deploy of the of CloudFormation templates is to use the appropriate Launch button.
 - Hourly
 - [BYOL](#byol)

**Hourly deploy button**

Use this button to deploy the **hourly** template: 

<a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=BigIp-1nic-Hourly&templateURL=https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f5-dev/existing-stack-hourly-1nic-bigip.template">
    <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png"/>
</a>
<br>
**Hourly Parameters**
After clicking the Launch button, you must specify the following parameters.


| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| adminPassword | x | Type the BIG-IP admin password |
| adminUsername | x | Common VPC for whole deployment |
| bigipExternalSecurityGroup | x | Public or External Security Group ID |
| imageName | x | F5 BIG-IP Performance Type |
| instanceType | x | BIG-IP virtual instance type |
| managementGuiPort | x | Port to use for the management port GUI |
| restrictedSrcAddress | x | The IP address range that can be used to SSH to the EC2 instances |
| sshKey | x | Name of an existing EC2 KeyPair to enable SSH acccess to the instance |
| subnet1Az1 | x | Public or External subnet ID |
| Vpc | x | Common VPC for the deployment |
| webserverPrivateIp | x | Web Server IP used for the BIG-IP pool member |

<a name="byol"></a>**BYOL deploy button**

Use this button to deploy the **BYOL** template: 

<a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=BigIp-1nic-BYOL&templateURL=https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f5-dev/existing-stack-byol-1nic-bigip.template">
    <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png"/>
</a>

**BYOL Parameters**
After clicking the Launch button, you must specify the following parameters.

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| adminPassword | x | Type the BIG-IP admin password |
| adminUsername | x | Common VPC for whole deployment |
| bigipExternalSecurityGroup | x | Public or External Security Group ID |
| imageName | x | F5 BIG-IP Performance Type |
| instanceType | x | BIG-IP virtual instance type |
| licenseKey1 | x | Type or paste your F5 BYOL regkey here |
| managementGuiPort | x | Port to use for the management port GUI |
| restrictedSrcAddress | x | The IP address range that can be used to SSH to the EC2 instances |
| sshKey | x | Name of an existing EC2 KeyPair to enable SSH acccess to the instance |
| subnet1Az1 | x | Public or External subnet ID |
| Vpc | x | Common VPC for the deployment |
| webserverPrivateIp | x | Web Server IP used for the BIG-IP pool member |

## Design Patterns


The goal is for the design patterns for all the iterative examples of F5 being deployed via ARM templates to closely match as much as possible.

### List of Patterns For Contributing Developers


 1. Still working on patterns to use

## Filing Issues

## Contributing

See `Contributing <CONTRIBUTING.md>`__

## Test


Before you open a pull request, your code must have passed a deployment into Azure with the intended result

## Unit Tests

Simply deploying the ARM template and completing use case fulfills a functional test
