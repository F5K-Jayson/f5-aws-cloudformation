# f5-aws-cloudformation
CloudFormation templates for F5 AWS deployments

Across all branches in this repository, two directories will exist, *f5_supported* and *experimental*. 

The *f5_supported* directory will contain reference templates that are officially tested and supported by F5 Networks. 

The *experimental* directory contains templates that are experimental. Use these templates as a reference [ but at your own risk ].


Descriptions for each template are provided at the top of each template in the "Description" key. 


For information about deploying them, see the README.md in the "deploy/" directory


For information on how these templates are generated, see README.md in the "build/" directory.
