# Deploying the BIG-IP in AWS - 2 NIC

[![Slack Status](https://f5cloudsolutions.herokuapp.com/badge.svg)](https://f5cloudsolutions.herokuapp.com)

## Introduction

This solution uses a Cloud Formation Template to launch a 2-NIC deployment of a BIG-IP VE in an Amazon Virtual Private Clould. In a 2-NIC implementation, one interface is for management and data-plane traffic from the Internet, and the second interface is connected into the Amazon networks where traffic is processed by the pool members in a traditional two-ARM design. Traffic flows from the BIG-IP VE to the application servers.

This solution provides two different template options:
  - **BYOL**<br>
  The BYOL (bring your own license) template allows you to input an existing BIG-IP license.
  - **Hourly**<br>
  The Hourly template which uses pay-as-you-go hourly billing
  
  The **existing stack** CloudFormation template incorporates an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). If you would like to run a *full stack* which creates and configures the BIG-IP, the AWS infrastructure, as well as a backend webserver, see the templates located in the **learning-stacks** folder.

## Prerequisites
The following are prerequisites for the F5 2-NIC CFT:
  - An AWS VPC with three subnets: 
    - Management subnet (called Public in the AWS UI)
    - External subnet (called Private in the AWS UI) 
    - NAT instance and associated network interface for network translation.
  - An AWS security group that allows port 22 for SSH access to BIG-IP VE
  - The AWS security group should include the GUI port you specify in the CFT (8443 by default) for BIG-IP access. It should also include any port required to access your application virtual server. The default virtual server port created by the template is 80.
  - Key pair for SSH access to BIG-IP VE (you can create or import in AWS)

## Supported instance types and hypervisors
  - For a list of supported AWS instance types for this solutions, see the **Amazon EC2 instances for BIG-IP VE** section of https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/bigip-ve-multi-nic-setup-amazon-ec2-12-1-0/1.html#guid-71265d82-3a1a-43d2-bae5-892c184cc59b

  - For a list versions of the BIG-IP Virtual Edition (VE) and F5 licenses that are supported on specific hypervisors and AWS, see https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/ve-supported-hypervisor-matrix.html.

## Installation

You have two options for deploying this template: 
  - Using the AWS deploy buttons 
  - Using [CLI Tools](#cli)

### Using the AWS deploy buttons
The easiest way to deploy of the of CloudFormation templates is to use the appropriate Launch button.
<br>
<br>

**Hourly deploy button**

Use this button to deploy the **hourly** template: 

<a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=BigIp-2nic-Hourly&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/f5-cft/f5-existing-stack-hourly-2nic-bigip.template">
    <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png"/>
</a>
<br>
<br>

After clicking the Launch button, you must specify the following parameters.
<br>

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| adminPassword | x | Type the BIG-IP admin password |
| adminUsername | x | Type the BIG_IP user name |
| bigipExternalSecurityGroup | x | Public or External Security Group ID |
| bigipManagementSecurityGroup | x | BIG-IP Management Security Group ID |
| imageName | x | F5 BIG-IP Performance Type |
| instanceType | x | BIG-IP virtual instance type |
| licenseKey1 | x | Type or paste your F5 BYOL regkey |
| managementSubnetAz1 | x | Management subnet ID |
| restrictedSrcAddress | x | The IP address range that can be used to SSH to the EC2 instances |
| sshKey | x | Name of an existing EC2 KeyPair to enable SSH acccess to the instance |
| subnet1Az1 | x | Public or External subnet ID |
| Vpc | x | Common VPC for the deployment |
| webserverPrivateIp | x | Web Server IP used for the BIG-IP pool member |

<br>
<br>

  **BYOL deploy button**

Use this button to deploy the **BYOL** template: 

<a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=BigIp-2nic-BYOL&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/f5-cft/f5-existing-stack-byol-2nic-bigip.template">
    <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png"/>
</a>

<br>
After clicking the Launch button, you must specify the following parameters.

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| adminPassword | x | Type the BIG-IP admin password |
| adminUsername | x | Type the BIG_IP user name |
| bigipExternalSecurityGroup | x | Public or External Security Group ID |
| bigipManagementSecurityGroup | x | BIG-IP Management Security Group ID |
| iamAccessKey | x | Type the IAM Access Key |
| iamSecretKey | x | Type the IAM Secret Key for BIG-IP |
| imageName | x | F5 BIG-IP Performance Type |
| instanceType | x | BIG-IP virtual instance type |
| licenseKey1 | x | Type or paste your F5 BYOL regkey here |
| licenseKey2 | x | Type or paste your F5 BYOL regkey here |
| managementSubnetAz1 | x | Management subnet ID |
| managementSubnetAz2 | x | Management subnet ID |
| restrictedSrcAddress | x | The IP address range that can be used to SSH to the EC2 instances |
| sshKey | x | Name of an existing EC2 KeyPair to enable SSH acccess to the instance |
| subnet1Az1 | x | Public or External subnet ID |
| subnet1Az2 | x | Public or External subnet ID |
| Vpc | x | Common VPC for the deployment |
| webserverPrivateIp | x | Web Server IP used for the BIG-IP pool member |

## Configuration Example <a name="config">

The following is a simple configuration diagram for this 2-NIC deployment. In this diagram, the IP addresses are provided as examples.

### Documentation
The ***BIG-IP Virtual Edition and Amazon Web Services: Multi-NIC Setup*** guide (https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/bigip-ve-multi-nic-setup-amazon-ec2-12-1-0.html) decribes how to create the configuration manually without using the CloudFormation template.  This document also decribes the configuration in more detail.

## Design Patterns


The goal is for the design patterns for all the iterative examples of F5 being deployed via ARM templates to closely match as much as possible.

### List of Patterns For Contributing Developers

See `Contributing <CONTRIBUTING.md>`__

## Test


Before you open a pull request, your code must have passed a deployment into Azure with the intended result

## Unit Tests

Simply deploying the ARM template and completing use case fulfills a functional test
